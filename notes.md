## Structure

Dependencies are stored in [`package.json`](package.json).

Do not configure `grunt` packages directly in the [`Gruntfile.js`](Gruntfile.js). Instead, store configurations in the [`grunt`](grunt) directory. You won't need a top-level key, since that's generated by the `Gruntfile.js` based on the filename of the configuration object stored in the `grunt` directory.

**Note:** developers who add link tags should be firmly reminded to follow directions
